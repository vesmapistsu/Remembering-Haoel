However, some players may want to play the game in Arabic, which is not officially supported by the developers. Fortunately, there is a way to patch the game files and enable Arabic subtitles and menus on PC. Here are the steps to do so:
 
1. Download the Arabic patch from [this link](https://soundcloud.com/inpofacsa/tomb-raider-2013-patch-arabic-pc). It is a zip file that contains two folders: "bigfile" and "localization".
2. Extract the zip file to a folder of your choice.
3. Go to the installation folder of Tomb Raider 2013 on your PC. It is usually located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Tomb Raider.
4. Backup the original "bigfile" and "localization" folders by renaming them or moving them to another location.
5. Copy the "bigfile" and "localization" folders from the Arabic patch to the installation folder of Tomb Raider 2013, replacing the original ones.
6. Launch the game from Steam or from the executable. You should see Arabic subtitles and menus in the game options.

Note: This patch only works for the Steam version of Tomb Raider 2013. It may not work for other versions or platforms. Also, this patch may not be compatible with future updates or DLCs of the game. Use it at your own risk.
