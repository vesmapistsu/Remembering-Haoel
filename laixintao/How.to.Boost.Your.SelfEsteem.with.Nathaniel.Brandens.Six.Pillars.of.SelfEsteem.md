Nathaniel Branden was a psychotherapist and a pioneer in the field of self-esteem. He developed a theory of six pillars of self-esteem that are essential for a healthy and positive self-image. These pillars are:
 
- **Living consciously**: This means being aware of your thoughts, feelings, actions, and goals. It also means being realistic, honest, and curious about yourself and the world.
- **Self-acceptance**: This means accepting yourself as you are, with your strengths and weaknesses. It also means respecting yourself and not judging yourself harshly.
- **Self-responsibility**: This means taking charge of your life and being accountable for your choices. It also means recognizing that you are the source of your happiness and well-being.
- **Self-assertiveness**: This means expressing yourself authentically and confidently. It also means standing up for your rights and values.
- **Living purposefully**: This means having clear and meaningful goals that motivate you. It also means pursuing your passions and talents.
- **Personal integrity**: This means being consistent and congruent with your principles and ideals. It also means honoring your commitments and promises.

By practicing these six pillars of self-esteem, you can improve your self-image and self-confidence. You can also enhance your personal growth and happiness. The book *Cei sase stalpi ai increderii in sine* provides practical exercises and examples to help you apply these principles to your life.
